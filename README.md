> **Blood Donation App**

Hello Everyone,

This application is an ongoing collaborative project made by the `Google Udacity Android Developer Scholarship Recipients`.

---

## how the app will work?
 * First of all, the one(Voluntary Donor) firstly makes an account on our app with general information(e.g. name, age) + his Blood Group + his live location(As per his permission) or City name.
 * On the second side, the one who needs blood will create a request for blood unit with his Location and all person near him(Our Voluntary Donors) will receive notification.(For example, `XYZ` needs blood at `XYZ hospital` or `123.456.789` location)
 
   **OR**
   
   We can show him all the blood donors with that particular blood group with the live location on the map. (Consider an example when we search for a cab on `Ola` or `Uber` app

## Benefits of the Project 

1) Reduce the wastage of blood. Usually, Blood banks store more blood so that they full fill every requirement because the demand for blood is undefined.
2) Sometimes people don't find blood at the correct time.This app can help there.
