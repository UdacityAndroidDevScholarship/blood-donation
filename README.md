# **Blood Donation App**

Hello Everyone,

This application is an ongoing collaborative project made by the `Google Udacity Android Developer Scholarship Recipients`.

---

## How the app will work?
 * This app keeps a list of voluntary donors.
 * A Voluntary Donor has to make an account on our app with some general information like:
    - Name
    - Age
    - Blood Group
    - City name [Can also provide access to his live location].
    
 * On the other side, the one who needs blood, will create a request for blood unit with his blood group and location.

### On Creating a Blood Request 
All persons near him i.e. *our voluntary donors* will receive notification for such request. (e.g. `Person A` needs blood at `XYZ hospital` or `123.456.789` location)
 
   **OR**
   
   The requester is shown a map of all the blood donors with the requested blood group with their live location near him. (Consider an example when we search for cab on `Ola` or `Uber` app)

## Benefits of the Project 

1) Connecting Blood Donors and Recipients.
   - Sometimes people don't find blood at the correct time. This app can help there by connecting donors and recipients.
2) Reduce the wastage of blood. 
   - Usually Blood banks store more blood so that they fulfil every requirement because the demand for blood is undefined.
